# DWM-Dracula-Rice
Simple DWM rice
To install this config for noobs, simply put the config.h file into your cloned DWM directory and compile it with `sudo make install clean`

I have also added pulse audio controls into the config to change the volume, hold `alt` and use `Z` or `X` to alter the volume up or down but you may change this in the config.
